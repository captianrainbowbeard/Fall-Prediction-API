# Fall-Prediction-API
Fall Prediction API
A Flask-based API for predicting fall events using a trained TensorFlow model. This API accepts input features, such as sensor data, and returns a predicted class indicating whether a fall is detected, predicted, or not detected. It is designed for integration with IoT devices, wearables, or health monitoring systems to provide real-time fall detection and prediction.

Features
REST API built with Flask
TensorFlow model for fall prediction
Supports multi-class classification:
Class 0: No fall detected
Class 1: Fall predicted
Class 2: Fall detected
Model deployment via ngrok for local testing
Easy to integrate with mobile apps, IoT devices, or external monitoring systems
Setup & Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fall-prediction-api.git
cd fall-prediction-api
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Train your model (or load an existing one) and place it in the appropriate directory:

python
Copy code
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('/path_to_model/my_model.keras')
Start the Flask server:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
For local testing and public access, use ngrok:

bash
Copy code
ngrok http 5000
Usage
Predict a Fall Event
To get predictions, send a POST request to /predict with a JSON payload containing the input features. Example:

sh
Copy code
curl -X POST https://<your-ngrok-url>/predict \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"features": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]}'
Example Response
json
Copy code
{
  "predicted_class": 1
}
Where the predicted class corresponds to one of the following:

0: No fall detected
1: Fall predicted
2: Fall detected
Deployment
You can deploy this API using services like Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean. Instructions for deploying on each platform are provided in the Deployment Guide.
